# oscm-identity
Identity Service for managing authentication with external IdPs using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)

## Building from source
To build the application
1. Download and install [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for you IDE. Instructions for Eclipse and IntelliJ can be found [here](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide).     
2. Run `mvn clean package`

## Starting the application
1. Copy *config* directory to the same path, where You've put Your JAR file
2. Provide default tenant configuration in *config/tenants/tenant-default.properties* where:
```properties
oidc.provider=external identity provider's name
oidc.clientId=oscm-identity must be register in external identity provider, this is the id of such registered application
oidc.clientSecret=secret key of the registered oscm-identity application
oidc.authUrl=url which is used for authenticating users
oidc.authUrlScope=scope of the authorization request
oidc.logoutUrl=url which is used for logging out users
oidc.tokenUrl=url which is used for retrieving the access token
oidc.redirectUrl=url which is used for token callback, must be register in your external identity provider list of URL responses
oidc.configurationUrl=url which delivers all necessary identity provider related informations
oidc.usersEndpoint=url which is used for accessing users resource
oidc.groupsEndpoint=url which is used for accessing groups resource
oidc.nonce=unique request identifier for tenant 
```
3. Start the application using `java -jar` command

## Application profiles
To make development process as easy as possible, this application supports several profiles, which can be used to run it in a way approprieate to the use case.
By default, application starts with `prod` profile, it is however possible to override this setting and specify active profile manually. To do that, just execute application with `-Dspring.profiles.active=[profileName]` JVM parameter. 

- **prod** - default profile for the application, where tenant config is retrieved from mapped, local file system directory
- **test** - profile used for testing. All required resources are retrieved from the classpath
- **dev** - development profile. It allows application to run under IDE. Retrieved resources from the classpath.

## Setup with Docker
The Identity Service is included with the OSCM Docker installation. Find the [description in the oscm-dockerbuild repository](https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm-dockerbuild#quick-start-oscm-with-docker) on how to install OSCM with docker-compose.
